The Xenopus glomus contains podocytes with well developed foot processes that are anatomically indistinguishable from the podocytes of adult glomeruli. The two glomera are linked via a narrow bridge called the glomeral nexus." [PMID:9268568, XB:curator \"Xenbase\"]

The lymphatic system of vasculature drains lymph fluid from the tissue spaces of most organs and returns it to the blood vasculature for recirculation. The lymphatic sytem functions in immune responses. Anurans generate a lot lymphatic fluid, largely as a consequence of their very `leaky' vasculature and high interstitial compliance. Lymph is ultimately pumped into the venous system by paired, dorsally located lymph hearts. Hedrick et al (2007) show that lung inflation and deflation assists lymph movement. Lymph is moved during lung deflation to the subvertebral sac from anterior and posterior lymph sacs. During lung inflation, increased lymph sac pressure moves lymph to axillary regions, where lymph hearts can return lymph to the vascular space. (see Hedrick et al 2007)."
