Yolky material is consumed and the fibre tracts and later the commissures develop.

These regions of neural crest can be divided into five main functional domains, which include the cranial, trunk, vagal and sacral neural crest, and cardiac neural crest. Neural crest cells are considered multipotent, and as they have the limited capacity for self renewal, they are regarded as stem-cell like." [AAO:0010578, XAO:CJZ]

The biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes), sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells (Ito cells), Kupffer cells, and pit cells (liver-specific natural killer cells) represent the majority of non- hepatocyte cell types in the liver.

def: "Part of the circulatory system which consists of a series of vessels which collect blood (exclusive of erythrocytes) which seep through capillary walls and return it to the veins. The lymphatic system of vasculature drains lymph fluid from the tissue spaces of most organs and returns it to the blood vasculature for recirculation. The lymphatic sytem functions in immune responses. Anurans generate a lot lymphatic fluid, largely as a consequence of their very leaky vasculature and high interstitial compliance. Lymph is ultimately pumped into the venous system by paired, dorsally located lymph hearts. Hedrick et al (2007) show that lung inflation and deflation assists lymph movement. Lymph is moved during lung deflation to the subvertebral sac from anterior and posterior lymph sacs. During lung inflation, increased lymph sac pressure moves lymph to axillary regions, where lymph hearts can return lymph to the vascular space (see Hedrick et al 2007)." [AAO:0010522, XAO:curator]
